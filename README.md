## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-image-processing-matlab.git
2. Install the required packages:

This project uses MATLAB and the Image Processing Toolbox. Ensure that you have MATLAB installed, along with the required libraries.

You can download MATLAB from the official MathWorks website.
The Image Processing Toolbox should be installed with MATLAB or can be added via the MATLAB Add-Ons.
Setup:

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder.
Open the .m script files in MATLAB and run them directly.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

MATLAB (with the Image Processing Toolbox)
MATLAB IDE (for running scripts and interacting with the code)

##Features
